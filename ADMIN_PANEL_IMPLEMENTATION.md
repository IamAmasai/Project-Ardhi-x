# ArdhiX System Connectivity, History, and Admin Panel Enhancement

## Implementation Summary

This implementation successfully adds comprehensive admin functionality, activity tracking, and role-based access control to the ArdhiX Land Registry System.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. **Navigation & Connectivity**
- ✅ Updated sidebar navigation to show all main pages
- ✅ Admin Panel link conditionally displayed for admin users only
- ✅ Seamless navigation with persistent user session and role

### 2. **Role-Based Authentication**
- ✅ Extended User type to support `admin` and `user` roles
- ✅ Admin users: Use email containing "admin" or "admin@ardhix.com"
- ✅ Regular users: Any other email address
- ✅ Role-based access control enforced throughout the application

### 3. **Document History & Activity Tracking**
- ✅ Comprehensive activity tracking system (`ActivityService`)
- ✅ Tracks document actions (upload, download, approve, reject, delete)
- ✅ Tracks property actions (create, update, delete, verify)
- ✅ Tracks user actions (login, logout, register, profile updates)
- ✅ Real-time activity logging when documents are uploaded/downloaded

### 4. **Admin Panel** (`/admin`)
- ✅ **Documents Tab**: View and manage all system documents with search functionality
- ✅ **Users Tab**: View all users with role badges, status indicators, and property counts
- ✅ **Activity Log Tab**: System-wide activity monitoring with detailed metadata
- ✅ Role-based access protection (redirects non-admins to dashboard)

### 5. **Enhanced History Page** (`/history`)
- ✅ **For Admin Users**: 
  - Shows "System History" with all user activities
  - "Admin View - All Users" badge displayed
  - User names prefixed to activities from other users
  - User IDs shown for activities from other users
- ✅ **For Regular Users**:
  - Shows "History" with only user-specific activities
  - No admin badges or user prefixes
  - Clean, personal activity timeline

### 6. **Documents Page Enhancements** (`/documents`)
- ✅ Upload functionality with loading states
- ✅ Download tracking with activity logging
- ✅ Live activity updates when actions are performed
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback

3. History page fetches activities based on user role
4. Admin panel displays system-wide data for admin users

### Security Features
- Route-level access control
- Role-based data filtering
- Authentication state management
- Session persistence with localStorage
